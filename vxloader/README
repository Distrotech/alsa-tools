    VXLOADER - Firmware loader for Digigram VX soundcards
	    Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>


GENERAL
=======

Vxloader is a helper program to load the firmware binaries
onto the Digigram's VX-board sound drivers.
The following modules require this program:
	snd-vx222, snd-vxpocket, snd-vxp440
These drivers don't work properly at all until the certain firmwares
are loaded, i.e. no PCM nor mixer devices will appear.


USAGE
=====

When vxloader is invoked without options, it will probe all existing
soundcards until a valid VX-driver is found.  If a valid VX-driver is
found, vxloader reads the board type from the driver.  The corresponding
firmware binaries are then read and transferred to the driver.
Finally, vxloader initializes the PCM and the mixer devices on the
driver for making the soundcard full functional.

Instead of auto-probing, you can specify the card number or the hwdep
device name via -c and -D options, respectively.

	% vxloader -c 1
	% vxloader -D hw:0

For loading the firmware automatically after the module is loaded, use
the post-install command.  For example, add the following entry to
/etc/modules.conf for VX222 driver:

	post-install snd-vx222 /usr/bin/vxloader

FILES
=====

The firmware binaries are installed on /usr/share/vxloader
(or /usr/local/share/vxloader, depending to the prefix option of
configure).  The file "index" specifies which files are used for each
type of the soundcard.  There are "board", "vx222", "vxpocket" and
"vxp440" types for the old VX222, VX222 v2/Mic, VXpocket v2, VXpocket
440, respectively.
